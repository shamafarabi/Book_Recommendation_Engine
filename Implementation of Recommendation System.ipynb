    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation engines have laid the foundation of every major tech company around us that provides retail, video-on-demand or music streaming service and thus redefined the way we shop, search for an old friend, find new music or places to go to. From finding the best product in the market to searching for an old friend online or listening to songs while driving, recommender systems are everywhere. A recommender system helps to filter vast amount of information from all users and item database to individual’s preference. For example, Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, and Spotify uses it to decide which song to play next for a user. \n",
    "Book reading apps like Goodreads has personally helped me to find books I couldn’t put away and thus getting back to the habit of reading regularly again. While a lot of datasets for movies (Netflix, Movielens) or songs have been explored previously to understand how recommendation engine works for those applications and what are the scopes of future improvement, book recommendation engines have been relatively less explored.\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to develop a collaborative book recommendation model using good#reads dataset that can suggest readers what books to read next. Additionally, data wrangling and exploratory data analysis will be utilized to draw insights about users reading preferences (e.g. how they like to tag, what ratings they usually provide etc.) and current trends in the book market (book categories that are in demand, successful authors in the market etc.)."

    "## Key Busieness Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Understanding User Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the tag counts of different generalized tag_names were ranked, the top 10 tag name shows that users prefer to have separate shelves for books they marked as favorite, read in a particular year (e.g. read in 1990, Childhood Books), owned or borrowed from library, read in a different format (e.g. ebook\\ audiobook). The other shelving preferance per the top 10 tag_names were different book categories such as 'Fiction', 'Young - Adult' etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The count plot of user provided ratings shows that users are more likely to rate a book 4 or higher. As the tag counts for books they mark as favorite is also higher (shown previosuly), it seems that users are more likely to rate and store a book when they like it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Users use a wide variety of names even if they are tagging a book in the same category. Foe example Science Fiction and Fantasy \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Factors to Consider for a Book's Rating**\n",
    "\n",
    "- EDA shows that the top 15 books per tag_count as reader's favorite is not same as the top 15 books ranked per ratings of the users. Also, while the average rating counts for the top 15 books marked as the reader's favorite is significantly higher (2191465) than the average ratings received by all books (23833), the avaerage rating counts (18198) for the top 15 books is below the average. Both favorite and top rated 15 books have higher average ratings (4.26 and 4.74 respectively compared to the average ratings of all books (4.01). These statistics suggest that only considering the average rating is not enough to rank books for recommendation. An an ideal metric should also consider how many times the book has been marked as favorite and the total number of ratings it received in addition to the average rating of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 9 of the top 15 favorite books are most frequently tagged in the Young - Adult Category.The other popular categories in the top 15 favorite books are science fiction and fantasy, romance, historical fiction or fiction in general. The harry potter books (ranked 2,3,4,6,7) have also been freqently tagged as children/childhood books. A quick look at the publication date of these books reveal that most of the books under Young Adult and Childhood categories were actually publsihed at least 10 years ago. Therefore, they were probably the favorite books of many adult readers when they were young. This highlights that the year of publication and dates of ratings can also impact a book's ranking and should be factored into the performance metric. To be able to determine if the books are equally liked by current generation of young readers, one can check if the average number of positive ratings recevied by a book per year has reduced or increased since its year of publication. As the datasets used in this project do not provide the dates when the books were rated, it was not possible to implement this scheme into the recommendation framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Book Categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the tag_counts of different book categories, it was found that 'Fiction' dominates as the popular category for users of all age groups (i.e. Adult and Young Adult readers). Beside fiction in general, tags related to 'Science Fiction and Fantasy' seems to be used more frequently than other categories in both adult and young adult section. Some other popular categories are Crime & Mysetery, Historical Fiction etc. Based on the findings, it seems that the demand for different kinds of fiction are higher than books based on actual events/facts (i.e. History or Science) in the market. The market seems to agree with these conclusions as about 43% of the books in the dataset are found to be Fiction, with Non - Fiction (20.5%), Young Adult (8.3%) and Science Fiction and Fantasy (5.73%) as other prevailing categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Does this finding indicate that a new Fiction has higher chances of getting a good rating than new history book? The answer is probably negative. When average ratings of different book categories were compared, it was found that readers do not have a bias towards rating a particular category higher than the others. The average rating in every category is close to the average rating of all the books (4.01) and mostly range from 3.25 to 4.75. Higher variability exists in the ratings of categories that have more books in the market than other categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Authors in Demand**\n",
    "\n",
    "- JK Rowling seems to be everyone's most favorite author with 4 of her books in the the 15 Favorite books. However, when authors were ranked per the number of books they wrote and the average ratings their books received, JK Rowling did not make it to the top 10. Stephen King seems to be the most successful authors with 44 books in the market with an average rating of 3.9. Other succesful authors considering both ratings and number of books are Dean Koontz, John Grisham, Nora Roberts and Jodi Picoult. This suggests that an ideal metric to evaluate an author's demand in the market should include the number of books an author wrote, the ratings the books received, the number of books that has been marked as favorite, and the tag counts as favorite for each book.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rating Counts per Book and Per User**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All the users in the dataset have rated at least 19 books where the most active users rated 200 books. 80% of the users rated at least 100 books\n",
    "- All the books in the dataset received at least 8 ratings. When books were ramked by rating_counts, it seems that the top 10 books recived more than 10,000 ratings. CDF plot of the ratings per book showed that only ~20% of the book received more than 5000 ratings.\n",
    "- As the number of books in the dataset 10000 are less than the number of users (53,424), sparsity is less likely to be an issue for ML modeling with this dataset."

    "\n",
    "- Data Wrangling step gave us an idea of how users like to tag\\shelf their books and the information was used to group books into different dominant categories based on the user provided tag names. The tag names used by different users can also be used as a repository for KW search. For example, it was found that users often used words like ya, YA, juvenile or teen to tag young - adult books \\children books. The recommendation system is designed to keep a collection of such frequently used words by exploring records of tag names, so that when users use those words in the search engine, it can be used  to find books in the relevant categories.  \n",

    "- The search results can also provide some built in suggestions to tag the books or further refine the search"
